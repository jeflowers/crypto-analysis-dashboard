# Cryptocurrency Analysis Dashboard

A cryptocurrency market data analysis dashboard built as a resume project to demonstrate full-stack development skills using modern technologies.

## Project Overview

This dashboard application was created to showcase capabilities in:

- Frontend development with React and data visualization
- Backend architecture and API integration
- Database design with both SQL and NoSQL systems
- Container orchestration and infrastructure automation
- CI/CD implementation

The application allows users to track and analyze cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other altcoins, with features like historical price visualization and market trend analysis.

## Technologies Demonstrated

### Frontend
- React.js with functional components and hooks
- TailwindCSS for responsive UI design
- Chart.js for data visualization components

### Backend
- Microservices approach with containerized services
- API integration with CoinMarketCap
- Data processing and transformation pipelines

### Databases
- PostgreSQL (RDBMS) for relational data modeling
- MongoDB (NoSQL) for time-series market data

### Infrastructure & DevOps
- Kubernetes concepts for container orchestration
- Podman for container management
- Ansible for infrastructure as code
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflow automation

## Features

### Data Visualization
- Multi-timeframe price charts (24h, 7d, 30d, 1y, 5y)
- Comparative analysis between multiple cryptocurrencies
- Market trends identification

### API Integration
- CoinMarketCap API integration
- Data caching and transformation
- Error handling and rate limit management

### Portfolio Concepts
- Watchlist functionality
- Performance tracking simulations
- Historical analysis tools
